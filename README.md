# Out-of-Pocket Healthcare Expenditure 
Project looking at the relationship between out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure and the outcome of healthcare, as well as factors that should improve healthcare quality. 

# Executive Summary of Project

• Project investigating the impact of out-of-pocket healthcare costs on healthcare outcomes, as well as the factors influencing these costs.

• The Global Country Information Data Set 2023 serves as the data set for evaluating these factors, sourced from an annually-updated global information set available on Kaggle, encompassing every country worldwide.

• Assuming the primary variable, out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure, takes into account all healthcare expenditure, including people with and without insurance.

• Notable Finding 1: Analysis reveals a negative correlation between patient healthcare expenditure and life expectancy, suggesting that as healthcare expenditure rises, life expectancy tends to decline.

• Notable Finding 2: Examination of infant and maternal mortality rates in relation to patient healthcare expenditure reveals that as healthcare spending increases, both infant and maternal mortality rates also rise.

• Notable Finding 3: The analysis of total tax rates in relation to healthcare expenditure indicates that countries with the lowest patient healthcare expenditure tend to have the highest rates of “low” tax rates. This suggests that lower healthcare costs are associated with lower tax burdens.

• Notable Finding 4: Investigation into the number of physicians per thousand people in relation to patient healthcare expenditure reveals that countries with the lowest healthcare expenditure costs tend to exhibit higher physician-to-population ratios.

• Notable Finding 5: Analysis of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in relation to patient healthcare expenditure reveals that countries in the lowest healthcare expenditure brackets exhibit the highest GDP levels.

• A limitation is that the data for healthcare expenditure variable doesn’t take into account if patients have insurance.

• To enhance the research, an equation could be fitted to the data with healthcare expenditure as the dependent variable.
